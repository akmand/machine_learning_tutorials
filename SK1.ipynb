    "The three common types of target feature $t$ are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Continuous targets**. For example, house prices; loan amounts.\n",
    "2. **Binary targets**. For instance, whether a patient has Type 2 diabetes or not; whether a loan will default or not.\n",
    "3. **Multinomial (a.k.a. multiclass) targets**. For example, five-level Likert items such as \"very poor\", \"poor\", \"average\", \"good\" and \"very good\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get familiar with some terminology. When the target feature is continuous, we coin it as a \"regression problem\". The predictive model is then called a \"regressor\". If the target feature is binary or multinomial, we say it is a \"classification problem\". In fact, binary is a special case of multinomial targets (it has only two classes). The model built is called a \"classifier\"."

Possible answers include \"coffee\", \"nice weather\", \"nice food\", or \"friendly people\". The answers to the survey are an example of \"multilabel\" target variables. The labels are not mutually exclusive as the survey participants could select more than one answer, for example (\"coffee\", \"nice weather\"), (\"coffee\"), (\"nice food\", \"friendly people\"), or \"all above\".\n",
