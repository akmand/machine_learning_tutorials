    "\n",
    "1. [Breast Cancer Wisconsin Data](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29). The target feature is binary, i.e., if a cancer diagnosis is \"malignant\" or \"benign\".\n",
    "2. [Wine Data](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/wine/wine.data). The target feature is multinomial. It consists of three classes of wines in a particular region in Italy.\n",
    "3. [Boston Housing Data](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/housing/). The target feature is continuous, which is the house prices in Boston in 1970's.\n",

    "## Why Evaluation? <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"why\"></a> \n",
    "\n",
    "Model evaluation is a necessary step in machine learning in order to accomplish the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Determine the \"best\" model\n",
    "* Estimate how the models will perform when deployed\n",
    "* Convince the end-users that the deployed model meets their needs\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two major considerations in evaluation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How shall we split the data for evaluation?\n",
    "2. Which metric(s) should we use for evaluation?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluation Procedures <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"procedures\"></a> \n",
    "\n",
    "With respect to the first consideration, we can split the dataset into a training set and a test set (also known as hold-out-sampling). Then we build a machine learning model on the training set and we evaluate how well the model performs on the test set. Data splitting is crucial to avoid or at least mitigate the issue of overfitting. \n",
    "\n",
    "A more robust and methodical approach to hold-out sampling is cross-validation. Also, another extension of cross-validation is repeated cross-validation (say 3 times) where data is partitioned into 5 (or sometimes 10) equal-sized chunks multiple times and the cross-validation procedure is repeated, each time with a different partitioning of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Choosing the Right Metric(s) <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"metrics\"></a> \n",
    "\n",
    "The second consideration is to choose the right metric(s), which is almost always problem-specific. Suppose the problem is a binary classification problem: either a patient is sick or healthy in a medical diagnosis setting. We want to predict a sick patient to be sick and, apparently we would never want to predict a sick patient to be healthy. However, there is no such thing as a perfect model and there is always some sort of trade-off involved. We can increase the cutoff threshold for scores to increase the chances of predicting a truly sick patient as sick, which would be increasing the true positive rate (TPR) (i.e., the recall). But there is no free lunch! Increasing TPR will probably lead to an increase in false positive rate (FPR) as well, i.e., predicting a healthy patient to be sick (a.k.a. false alarms). We discuss this issue of finding the \"sweet balance\" between TPR and FPR further below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Commonly used evaluation metrics for a binary classifier are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Simple classification accuracy,\n",
    "* Average class accuracy (using either arithmetic or harmonic mean),\n",
    "* Confusion matrix,\n",
    "* Area under ROC curve (AUC), and\n",
    "* Classification report.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the binary evaluation metrics can be extended to multinomial classification problems with some caveats. Meanwhile, evaluating a regressor is simpler. We do not need to adjust prediction score (in fact, we cannot). Popular metrics for regression are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Root mean squared error (RMSE),\n",
    "* R-squared ($R^2$), and \n",
    "* Mean absolute error (MAE).\n",
    "\n",

    "In the previous section, we saw how the TPR and TNR are calculated from a confusion matrix. As explained in Chapter 8 of our textbook, these measures are tied to the threshold used to convert probability scores to predictions. By default, `Scikit-Learn` models predict on the data based on a threshold value of 0.5. If we change the threshold, the confusion matrix will also change. For instance, as the threshold decreases, both TPR and FPR increase. The opposite holds when the threshold increases. To capture this trade-off, we use ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curves. For instance, decreasing the score threshold would be moving to the right on the ROC curve. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) together with the F1 score are some of the most popular metrics for evaluating binary classifiers as they are robust to the class imbalance issue in general.\n",
    "\n",
    "In `Scikit-Learn`, a quick way to get AUC is to use `metric.roc_auc_score`. But first we will retrain the model with AUC as our performance metric."

    "Multinomial classification refers to prediction problems where the target feature is multinomial (a.k.a. multiclass). That is, the target feature is categorical with at least three different levels. For multinomial classification illustration, we use the [Wine Data](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/wine/wine.data). The target feature refers to three different classes of wines in a particular region in Italy. Although multinomial classification is a generalization of the binary case, we cannot use the following binary metrics to evaluate a multinomial classifier:\n",

    "KNN has a lower test MAE error and a higher $R^{2}$ than DT. Thus, KNN outperforms DT with respect to these two metrics as well. In practice though, using a different metric during hyperparameter tuning will likely result in a different model evaluation. Recall that we used MSE to optimize the hyperparameters of each model. In our case, it is just a coincidence that KNN has lower MSE and MAE values and a higher $R^2$ than DT. In summary, whatever metric you want to optimize, you should use the same metric for both hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation. That is, you should avoid using different metrics for tuning and evaluation.\n",

    "1. There are many ways to evaluate multiple models in `scikit-learn`. Our example makes use of dictionaries and for loops because this approach is easier. Other approaches include utilizing `pipeline` from `scikit-learn` or defining our own \"classes\" in an object-oriented programming framework. We do not cover the latter.\n",
    "2. `GridSearchCV` allows to optimize parameters using multiple metrics. Again we do not cover in this tutorial because it would return a `GridSearchCV` object with nested information.\n",
    "3. We can define our own performance metrics. If you are curious, please refer to \"[How to make scorer in scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.make_scorer.html#sklearn.metrics.make_scorer)\"."

    "The regression metrics help us evaluate and rank model performance. However, using metrics alone cannot help us validate the models, including checking the underlying model assumptions. The model validation process primarily stems from statistics. One way to validate a model is to conduct a residual analysis. Residual is the difference between an actual value and a predicted value.

The intuition is that if a regression model has a good predictive power, its predictions should not deviate too much from the actual values. Likewise, we would expect residual values to be close to zero on average for a good model.\n",

    "Data is unlikely to be constant (or stable) forever. For example, consumers change their spending habits and housing prices fluctuate over time. This is known as \"concept drift\" (Kelleher, Namee & D'Arcy, 2015). Thus, it is important to monitor the model performance in an on-going validation framework. Below are some common approaches to monitor changes in the underlying process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Monitoring changes in model performance metrics.\n",
    "2. Monitoring model output (target) distribution changes using stability index.\n",
    "3. Monitoring descriptive feature distribution changes.\n",
    "4. Conducting comparative experiments using control groups.\n",
