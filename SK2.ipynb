    "The topics of this tutorial are feature selection and feature ranking (such as \"what are the most important 5 features?\"). Feature selection is usually an overlooked issue in machine learning. In many cases, using all the descriptive features that are available can lead to excessive computational times, overfitting, and poor performance in general. It's always a good idea to check to see if we can achieve better performance by employing some sort of feature selection before fitting a model. Feature selection can also be performed in conjunction with the modeling process (as part of a machine learning pipeline), which is discussed in **SK Part 5**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "* Perform feature selection and ranking using the following methods:\n",
    "  - F-score (a statistical filter method)\n",
    "  - Mutual information (an entropy-based filter method)\n",
    "  - Random forest importance (an ensemble-based filter method)\n",
    "  - SPSA (a new wrapper method developed by [V. Aksakalli et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.05589))\n",
    "* Compare performance of feature selection methods using paired t-tests. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's discuss some terminology.\n",
    "\n",
    "The classifier used to assess performance of the feature selection methods is called the \"wrapper\". Here, we use the 1-nearest neighbor as the wrapper. As for the sample data, we use the breast cancer Wisconsin dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first three methods are **\"filter methods\"**: they examine the relationship between the descriptive features and the target feature and they select features only once regardless of which classifier shall be used subsequently.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last method is a **\"wrapper method\"**: it selects a different set of features for each wrapper. Wrapper feature selection methods are relatively slow and they need to be executed again when a different wrapper is used. For instance, the best 5 features selected by a wrapper method for 1-nearest neighbor will probably be different than the best 5 features for decision trees. However, wrapper methods attempt to solve the \"real problem\": \"what the best subset of features when, say, the 1-nearest neighbor classifier is used?\". They tend to perform somewhat better than the filter methods at the cost of more computational resources and a different set of features for each classifier."

In order to mitigate this issue, a more appropriate approach would be to perform this comparison within a **train/ test split approach**. Specifically, we can split the entire data into two partitions, a train and a test data. We can find the top features using the **train data** using cross-validation. Next, we can assess the performance of these features on the **test data**, again using cross-validation."
